Project Whiskers!  Or Whiskr, The CATS time tracker! Since it sounds way more Web 3.0 or San Francisco startup culture or some shit I don’t know

To-Do:

Determine stack, get it up and running.  Since this is will likely be a low resource app, I’m gonna see if I can create an Amazon Web Services account we can share, and get a Debian minimal instance running with whatever stack we decide on. We would be able to use that for a year free of charge so long as we stick to “Mini Instances” which shouldn’t be a problem.

Discuss Stopwatch Class
•	I’d imagine we want this pretty stripped down since there will be a ton of instances of this class.
•	What is the bare minimum needed here? Which attributes and methods are required for every stopwatch we create?
•	I have no idea what I’m doing, I’ve never written a piece of software alone, let alone tried to think about how it would work beforehand oh god please halp I need an adult

I’ll create a GitHub repo and To-Do thingy on the repo as well as see what is involved in getting a mail distro created on it for us for discussion, or a forum.
